Tests are a way to verify that the code we write functions as expected. They are written to check the functionality of the code and ensure that it works without errors. Mocks are objects that simulate real objects in order to test the functionality of our code. They enable greater code testing and help in diagnosing problems with the code. Refactoring code refers to the process of improving the structure and readability of code without changing its behavior. It is a best practice technique that helps make the code more efficient, easier to maintain, and improve its quality.
Tests refer to assessments designed to measure a person's knowledge, skills, abilities or other characteristics. Tests can be either standardized or non-standardized. Standardized tests are those that are administered and scored in a consistent manner while non-standardized tests do not have a standardized scoring method. Some common examples of tests include achievement tests, aptitude tests, personality tests and standardized tests such as the SAT or GRE. Tests are often used in educational or employment settings to evaluate a person's performance or suitability for a certain position or task.
